She has spent her entire life living by the water…and the relaxed coastal influences are reflected in her work. Renee is most at home in nature or by the sea. She loves nothing more than a day on the coast with her camera…being led by nature as her muse. As she wanders, she captures the nuances of the surrounding natural beauty, focusing in on details that are often overlooked. Renee’s many travels and “wanderings” have led her to photograph the beauty of nature’s land, sand, sea & flora. From the coastlines to the deserts, she captures the subtle movements, light, textures and colors of the landscape, as her photos are snapshots in time of a beautiful world we all long to WANDER.
